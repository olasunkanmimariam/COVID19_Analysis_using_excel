# Airlines Delay Storytelling
This project is based on Airlines delay in US and it's a capstone project on the #30DaysOfLearning

Flight delay is a serious, widespread problem in US and has a severe economic impact. 
The delay may result from airlines operation, air traffic congestion, weather, air traffic management initiation

The main focus of this project is to analyze the data and build a stunning storytelling dashboard using PowerBI

## Data Source
Link to the dataset used https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jimschacko/airlines-dataset-to-predict-a-delay

## Data Transformation
Transformation and preparation of the data was done using power query editor.

Ensuring the right data types

Creation of new measures (Total flight distance, Total flight duration, Average flight distance, count of delayed and non delayed flight, 
percentage of delayed and non delayed flight) etc

Extraction of flight location for the 'airport from' and 'airport to'

## Insights

## Conclusion and Recommendation

Passenger suffers a loss of time, missed business opportunities or leisure opprotunities. Airlines attempting to make up 
for the delay leads to extra fuel consumption and a large adverse environmental impact
